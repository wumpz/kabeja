   * Ensures that the DraftEntity's coordinates are in WCS rather than OCS. Should only ever be
   * called on completely built entities, i.e. after the entity's group has benn parsed entirely.
   *
   * <p>Implementing this method is necessary only for planar entities (circle, arc, solid,
   * trace,text, attrib, attdef, shape, insert, 2Dpolyline, 2D vertex, lwpolyline, hatch, image),
   * since their coordinates get stored in the OCS.
   *
   * <p>In this case the method does not simply translate the coordinates, but "reverts" the
   * arbitrary axis algorithm's effects. This means that an Entity with Extrusion != (0,0,1), that
   * might have appeared "flipped" without the transformation, will be "unflipped".
   *
   * <p>3D-Entities (line, point, 3dface, 3Dpolyline, 3D vertex, 3D mesh, 3D meshvertex) can leave
   * this method's body empty, since their coordinates are already in WCS. For them this method
   * should do nothing.
